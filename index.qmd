Greetings and welcome to my website! I'm Justine Shakespeare, a seasoned professional with over a decade of experience in research and project management. Recently, I completed an advanced graduate certificate in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In this program I greatly enhanced my technical skills in data analytics, quantitative analysis, research design, and survey methodology. You can check out some of the work I completed for this program and on my own on the [Projects](https://jns2589.github.io/jshakespeare/Projects.html) page. You can also see a curated selection of my work at the international labor giths NGO [Verite](http://verite.org) on the Professional Work page. 


With a strong foundation in project management and research design, coupled with my newfound proficiency in data analytics, I'm eager to integrate my diverse skill set to drive impactful outcomes. Join me as we embark on a journey to leverage data-driven insights and innovative solutions to address complex challenges.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing insights and experiences with you.
