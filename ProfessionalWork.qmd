While at the international labor rights NGO [Verite](http://verite.org) I specialized in managing research projects on forced labor, human trafficking and the exploitation of migrant workers in global supply chains. I was instrumental in the development of pioneering forced labor research methodology in Southeast Asia and co-authored a first-of-its-kind study on forced labor in the Malaysian electronics industry. See the following links for the  [Report](https://verite.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VeriteForcedLaborMalaysianElectronics2014.pdf) and [Media coverage](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/business/international/report-cites-forced-labor-in-malaysia.html).
