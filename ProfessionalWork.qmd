While at the international labor rights NGO [Verité](http://verite.org) I specialized in managing research projects on forced labor, human trafficking and the exploitation of migrant workers in global supply chains. Here are some featured projects from my time as a Senior Program Manager in the research and policy department:

### Research: Forced Labor in the Production of Electronic Goods in Malaysia

I was instrumental in the development of pioneering forced labor research methodology in Southeast Asia and co-authored a first-of-its-kind study on forced labor in the Malaysian electronics industry. See the New York Times coverage of the release of this report [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/business/international/report-cites-forced-labor-in-malaysia.html).

### CUMULUS Forced Labor Screen

I also drove efforts to utilize data and technology to combat forced labor and human trafficking by increasing transparency in corporate supply chains and empowering workers around the world. I was the cofounder and co-inventor of the patented technology platform.

### STREAMS Traceability Matrix

While this project has continued beyond my time at Verité, I was part of the initial team that conceptualized and designed the Traceability Matrix. I also researched and wrote most of the content of the [Traceability Technology Page](https://traceabilitymatrix.org/traceability-technology/).
